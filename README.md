# Attendance-using-Face-Detection-and-Recognition-through-Moodle

This project was created to provide the faculty with the option to take manual or automatic attendance using their mobile phone camera. The project detects faces in real-time from the pictures captured by the faculty, recognizes the detected faces by the use of a machine learning algorithm and, updates the class attendance on the Moodle software deployed on the server.
